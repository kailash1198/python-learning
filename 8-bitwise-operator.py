#Bitwise operator in python
# works on bit manipulation

# Perform a bitwise AND operation between 10 and 6.
# Perform a bitwise OR operation between 12 and 5.
# Perform a bitwise XOR operation between 15 and 7.
# Perform a bitwise left shift operation on 8 by 2 bits.
# Perform a bitwise right shift operation on 16 by 3 bits.
# Set the 3rd bit (from the right, starting from 0) of the number 9.
# Clear the 2nd bit of the number 13.
# Toggle the 4th bit of the number 11.

# bitNumberOne = 10
# bitNumberTwo = 20

# if(bitNumberOne & bitNumberTwo):
#     print("True")
# else:
#     print("Flase")
    
    
if(10 & 6):
    print("Sucess")
else:
    print("False")
